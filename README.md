# BMICalculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) can be useful in diagnostic procedure, as it gives a general indication of the degree of obesity for a person.
BMI is defined as the quotient of weight to the square of height (in units kg / m2).

The most commonly used price limits are:

  * BMI < 18,5 UNDERWEIGHT
  * 18,0 <= BMI < 25,0 NORMAL
  * 25,0 <= BMI < 30,0 OVERWEIGHT
  * 30,0 <= BMI OBESITY
  
The purpose of this work is to create a program that will facilitate the calculation of BMI, and will suggest the corresponding loss (or increase) 
of body weight that required for the BMI to change to normal levels.
The program guides the user in entering correct data, while also supporting reading large set of input data from an external file.
